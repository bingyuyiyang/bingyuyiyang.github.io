  title={Analysis of Traffic Properties of Commuters in a Speed-Limit Corridor with Toll Station under Microscopic Method},
  abbr={JTE},
  author={Zhao, Jing and Li, Peng and Zheng, Zhe and Han, Yin},
  abstract={This study applies the full velocity difference (FVD) model to investigate commuters’ driving process in a speed limit corridor with a toll station and explains how some factors affect the outflow of the traffic corridor system from the microscopic perspective. First, a micromodel system is constructed to depict the commute process in a traffic corridor with a toll station considering the speed limit. Second, a metastable state is defined in the paper for deriving the properties of commute problem conveniently. Finally, numerical tests are conducted to investigate some factors’ effects on traffic properties. This study concludes that many traffic properties will be convergent when the commuter’s number increases, and that the length of the road, the speed limit, and the service time of the toll station have effects on the time headway of the origin at the equilibrium state. The results show how the outflow forms in a speed-limit corridor with a toll station from the microscopic perspective and provide insights for policymaking.},

  author={Malenje, Jairus Odawa and Zhao, Jing and Li, Peng and Han, Yin},
  journal={PLoS one},
  abbr={Plos One},
  abstract={The vehicle-pedestrian encounter at midblock crosswalks in urban centers is inevitable but the challenge to urban transportation planners is in achieving a balance between traffic flow efficiency and pedestrian safety. Vehicles are expected to yield to pedestrians who have a right of way at the midblock unsignalized crosswalks but, failure to yield causes conflicts that at times are fatal. This study investigated the effect of macroscopic factors on the vehicle yielding. Six environmental factors are considered: temporal gap size, number of traffic lanes, number of waiting pedestrians, position of pedestrian (whether on street kerb or median), traffic flow direction and presence (or absence) of monitoring ePolice. Video Data on six observed variables that influenced vehicle yielding was collected from 13 uncontrolled crosswalk locations in Shanghai city in the Peoples Republic of China. A Logit model with a 95.9% accuracy was developed to describe the vehicle yielding behavior. The results showed that gap size and number of traffic lanes had the highest influence on driver yielding decision and that drivers were more likely to yield if ePolice was present. The sensitivity analysis was conducted and appropriate recommendations on improving the pedestrians crossing safety were proposed accordingly.},

  abbr={IET},
  author={An, Xu and Zhao, Jing and Li, Peng and Ma, Xiaodan},
  abstract={The traffic weaving area is one of the key bottlenecks affecting the operation efficiency of an urban expressway system. The main motivation of this study is to explore the effects of lane allocation on the operational efficiency at weaving areas. A cellular automaton model was established, in which three different lane-changing rules were considered to match the driving behaviour when the lanes are allocated. Using the average vehicular travel time and the average velocity as the indicators, the operational performance of various lane allocation schemes was compared under different traffic and geometric conditions. A case study is used to validate and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the benefits of the lane-allocation strategy are affected by the traffic flow, weaving volume ratio, weaving length, and installation location of the isolation facilities. The lane-allocation strategy has promising application under the conditions of a traffic flow that is >400 veh/ln, at weaving volume ratio between 0.2 and 0.7, and weaving length shorter than 300 m. Moreover, the isolation facilities should cover the weaving area when the lane-allocation strategy is used.},

  title={Analysis of saturation flow rate at tandem intersections using field data},
  abbr={IET},
  author={Zhao, Jing and Li, Peng and Zheng, Zhe and Han, Yin},
  abstract={A tandem intersection is an unconventional intersection design that possesses the important property of increasing the traffic capacity using pre-signals and sorting areas. However, the operational efficiency of the lanes in the sorting areas may be affected by driver unfamiliarity and confusion. This study evaluates the effect of the tandem control on the saturation flow rate using field data. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify the difference in the saturation flow rate of the approach lanes when the tandem control was open and closed. A saturation flow rate adjustment model for tandem control was established in accordance with three factors: unequal distribution of traffic, red light violations at the pre-signal, and incomplete discharge of vehicles at the sorting area. The results indicate that the tandem control decreases the saturation flow rate of the approach lanes in the sorting area. Most of the observed reductions are caused by the first factor, i.e. the unequal distribution of traffic. The other two factors, red light violations and incomplete discharge, can be controlled by using appropriate traffic signs, markings, and signal timing design.},

  abbr={Physica A},
  abstract={Pedestrian illegal crossings at midblock are very unpredictable and pose a potential tragic conflict with vehicles besides generally disrupting the normal flow of traffic. The drivers need to not only anticipate but also respond to their actions accordingly to avoid potential conflicts. The objective of this paper was to describe the behavior of the drivers under illegal pedestrian crossing circumstances by proposing an extended car-following model, and then analyze the impacts of the illegal pedestrian crossing on the normal traffic flow at the midblock. In this study, three conditions have been considered, namely: no pedestrians, pedestrians present but waiting, and pedestrians crossing. The numerical results illustrate that the disruptive nature of the illegal pedestrian crossing could worsen when the number of pedestrian is large, the pedestrian platoon size is small, and the speed limitation is high.},

  author={Zhao, Jing and Ma, Wanjing and Li, Peng},
  journal={Journal of transportation engineering, Part A: Systems},
  abbr={JTE},
  abstract={Midblock crosswalks are installed mainly at locations with heavy pedestrian traffic to increase the accessibility of points along the streets to pedestrians. However, midblock crosswalks may cause additional delays for vehicles. This paper presents an integrated design method for midblock crosswalks that balances the trade-off between the efficiency of vehicle operation and pedestrian crossing by making full use of the vehicular red time at the downstream intersection. The method combines location selection and signal timing in a unified optimization model that is formulated as a multiobjective linear programming problem. The Pareto frontier of the proposed model is obtained by iterating all possible combinations of the weights of the two objectives. For each combination of weights, the optimization problem becomes a single-objective mixed-integer linear programming problem that can be solved with the standard branch-and-bound technique. The results of extensive numerical analyses and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and indicate its promising application in providing additional crosswalks for pedestrians while only slightly impacting vehicular operations},

  abstract={This article presents a generalized diversion control model for freeway incident management that is capable of concurrently optimizing the detour rates and arterial signal timings over multiple roadway corridor segments between the freeway and its neighboring arterial. To capture various operational complexities due to the interactions between multiple diversions, this study has developed an extended corridor traffic flow model and integrated it in the overall optimization process. A biobjective control model is developed to maximize the utilization of available corridor capacity while not significantly increasing the total time spent by travelers on the detour route to ensure their compliance to the routing guidance. Genetic algorithm integrated with the rolling time horizon approach is employed to solve the proposed model. Case studies with a stretch of the I‐94 corridor westbound from downtown Milwaukee to Waukesha have demonstrated the potential of the developed model for use in nonrecurrent congestion management.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
