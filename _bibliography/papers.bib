  title={Analysis of saturation flow rate at tandem intersections using field data},
  abbr={IET},
  author={Zhao, Jing and Li, Peng and Zheng, Zhe and Han, Yin},
  abstract={A tandem intersection is an unconventional intersection design that possesses the important property of increasing the traffic capacity using pre-signals and sorting areas. However, the operational efficiency of the lanes in the sorting areas may be affected by driver unfamiliarity and confusion. This study evaluates the effect of the tandem control on the saturation flow rate using field data. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify the difference in the saturation flow rate of the approach lanes when the tandem control was open and closed. A saturation flow rate adjustment model for tandem control was established in accordance with three factors: unequal distribution of traffic, red light violations at the pre-signal, and incomplete discharge of vehicles at the sorting area. The results indicate that the tandem control decreases the saturation flow rate of the approach lanes in the sorting area. Most of the observed reductions are caused by the first factor, i.e. the unequal distribution of traffic. The other two factors, red light violations and incomplete discharge, can be controlled by using appropriate traffic signs, markings, and signal timing design.},

  title={A generalized integrated corridor diversion control model for freeway incident management},abbr={Computer-Aided},
  author={Liu, Yue and Li, Peng and Wehner, Kevin and Yu, Jie},
  abstract={This article presents a generalized diversion control model for freeway incident management that is capable of concurrently optimizing the detour rates and arterial signal timings over multiple roadway corridor segments between the freeway and its neighboring arterial. To capture various operational complexities due to the interactions between multiple diversions, this study has developed an extended corridor traffic flow model and integrated it in the overall optimization process. A biobjective control model is developed to maximize the utilization of available corridor capacity while not significantly increasing the total time spent by travelers on the detour route to ensure their compliance to the routing guidance. Genetic algorithm integrated with the rolling time horizon approach is employed to solve the proposed model. Case studies with a stretch of the I‚Äê94 corridor westbound from downtown Milwaukee to Waukesha have demonstrated the potential of the developed model for use in nonrecurrent congestion management.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
