Ph.D Candidate, Rutgers University.
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cYCU2F8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="\_blank"}

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Supply Chain Management at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include Electric Vehicle Battery management and Online review platform, advised by [Dr. Lian Qi](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/faculty/lian-qi){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Yao Zhao](http://zhao.rutgers.edu/index.htm){:target="\_blank"}

Prior to joining RBS, I have completed my Ph.D degree in Transportation Engingeering at [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Dr. Yue Liu](https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/liu-ph-d-yue/){:target="_blank"}.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
