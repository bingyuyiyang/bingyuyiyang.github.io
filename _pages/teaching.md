I am a teaching assistant in Supply Chain Management at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"} from Fall 2017 to present. I have learned useful teaching philosophy from different instructors who are not only have strong research skills but also have good teaching experiences.

Prior to joining RBS, I have teached two courses in Spring and Fall 2015 at [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

**Instructor at University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee:**

**Teaching Philosophy:**

As Einstein said, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." I believe that an excellent teacher does not motivates students to learn, but also can convert the abstract and theoretical concepts from the textbook into an intelligible in real life. Thus, the goal of my teaching courses is to stimulate students' interest and explore their potential to solve real-world problems, while addressing the fundamental impact of the course in the entire supply chain field. Overall, my teaching thrusts can be summarized as follows. 
- **Critical thinking & relating that to practice：**


- Flora Park, a competitive and collaborative supply chain management


- **Interactive learning with multi-media usage**
- Tableau, Visualization, 

- **Teamwork development**
- team project, communication skills, and presentation skills.
- peer evaluation for the presentation
