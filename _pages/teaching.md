I am a teaching assistant in Supply Chain Management at [Rutgers Business School](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/) from Fall 2017 to current. The courses are listed as follows. 

For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!
