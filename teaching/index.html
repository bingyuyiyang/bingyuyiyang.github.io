    <p>I am a teaching assistant in Supply Chain Management at <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">Rutgers University</a> from Fall 2017 to present. I have learned many teaching skills and summarized my teaching goals from these experenced professors.</p>

<p>Prior to joining RBS, I have independently taught two courses in Spring and Fall 2015 at <a href="https://uwm.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Instructor at University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>CE202 Dynamics, Lab section, 26 students, evaluation 3.9/5.0 Fall 2015</li>
  <li>CE250 Surveying Engineering, Lab section, 16 students, evaluation 3.8/5.0 Fall 2015</li>
  <li>CE202 Dynamics , Lab section, 28 students, evaluation 4.1/5.0 Spring 2015</li>
  <li>CE250 Surveying Engineering, Lab section, 15 students, evaluation 4.5/5.0 Spring 2015</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teaching Philosophy:</strong></p>

<p>As Albert Einstein said, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” I believe an excellent teacher not only motivates students to learn but can convert the abstract and theoretical concepts from the textbook into intelligible practice in real life. Thus, the goal of my teaching is always to stimulate students’ interest and explore their potential to solve real-world problems, while addressing the fundamental impact of the course in the entire supply chain field. Comparing with simply teaching from the textbook, I prioritize develop their potential in critical thinking, teamwork spirit, and communication skills. Overall, my teaching goals can be summarized
as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Critical thinking &amp; relating that to practice：</strong>
Critical thinking is an important skill as students learn to break down a problem into small parts to understand better the antecedents and details of the problem as well as possible solutions. With the skill,students will be trained to use their knowledge to generate new and creative alternatives to solve the problems they will face in their field, particularly in the business
world. In order to help them decide what they want and experience a real sense
of connection, I will also encourage students to observe and evaluate their colleagues’ presentations. The students will base their evaluation on criteria such as originality, creativity, knowledge, and overall image of the others’ presentations. Presentation of this style not only helps students observe their peers closely but encourages honest reflections on themselves at the same time. More than simply passing down a set of presentation skills to students, this approach motivates them to make independent comments to each other and authentically apply critical thinking in the evaluation process. Students are thus better prepared for their business life in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interactive learning with multi-media usage:</strong>
I also believe that challenges make good students. The students who are not challenged intellectually become uninterested very soon. To retain students’ passion and improve their competitive and collaborative skills, I intend to utilize the Supply Chain Strategy Game in my class, such as Flora Park Game, so as for them to learn how to make strategic thinking and joint Supply Chain and Marketing decisions. Based on the Game playing, for instance, I will request students to analyze the virtual flora market from the perspective of importer and florist to learn how to manage partner conflict, negotiate supply chain
contracts, achieve a win-win status in the entire supply chain. I believe in the current situation of pandemic, the FlipGrid will be a good option for an online course where students can connect and interact and actively engage in the learning process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Teamwork development:</strong>
I believe having students work on team-based learning exercises or projects is of critical importance. For instance, I form a few groups to simulate the supply chain which includes importers and florists in the Flora Park Game. To win the competition, students need to share their information in a way that contributes to advancing the whole team assignments. Accordingly, not only do they need to learn how to deal with conflicts within a team, but they need to pick up how to improve negotiation or communication skills across groups to achieve a win-win.  At the same time, the teamwork project presentation develops the students’ ability to sell their ideas in the business world collaborating with others. Students will be able to work together, organize and select key information for a presentation, utilize technology to enhance the presentation level, and practice delivery of the information confidently and professionally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embrace the diversity of students:</strong>
 As the student population becomes more and more diverse, challenges and opportunities unfold simultaneously. As a teacher, I have had experience working with students from various backgrounds and with a wide range of goals and needs. When students ask about assignments, exams, or projects, I listen to them carefully, strive to make sure that the answers provided are easy to understand based on students’ unique situation. I believe I can contribute significantly to my students’ personal growth and can motivate them to achieve their educational goals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have successfully brought my teaching experience and teaching goals to the class. The good feedbacks from my students will motivate me greatly to do well in the future.</p>
